so I was on reddit wonderin' for what ever reason, and then I saw a reddit post of some dude that is strugglin' with his code,
the reddit post in question: https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/140t56y/platformer_game_keeps_crashing/
I took one look at that disaster of a code and then I said: "WTF is this abomination!? (╬⁽⁽ ⁰ ⁾⁾ Д ⁽⁽ ⁰ ⁾⁾)",
I was bored at the time,
so I said to my self after a while: "why not fix it?, it's not like I have any thing better to do",
so I opened vs code and started fixin' that crap of a code,
and it only took one look at that eye-burnin' code to say: "nah, this code is truly beyond fixin', I gotta rewrite that shit,
I mean, loadin' a gif image to pygame!?, is this dude really tryin' his best to make me lose my sanity ʘ‿ʘ!?",
and then I started writin' a less hard-coded mess than whatever crap that dude wrote,
and that's how "jumpy" was born:),
it took me 6 days to finish this bad boy:)),
I kinda had fun with it, like every time I read "jumpy" it just cracks me up XD,
I never published a project before,
heck that's the first time I actually finish a project💀,
it's not complete though,
if you go to "assets" you will find a handfull of unused images and sounds,
and I gotta admit,
I kinda rushed some of this code, like the player's eye class and the main class,
I mean this project was supposed to be a quick practice that helps me learn new ways of codin' you know,
"why didn't you explain your code and instead of that you're tellin' me your life story" you ask?,
because I'm lazy af💀,
if you're havin' trouble understandin' my code,
just google what you don't understand, try reverse engineerin' my code and editin' it your way,
believe me it's just a simple 1+1 dude,
and now that you know why and how this game was made, maybe it'll help you learn new way's of codin' to :b.


"who are you" you ask?,
you can call me Super N,
and no -_-,
the "N" in my name does not stand for the n-word,
it's basically the first letter of my real name,
and "Super" is my brand😉,
"I didn't ask you anything weirdo, and stop sayin' things about me that I didn't say" you say?,







look behind you,




just jokin'😂,
lol,
I was messin' around with ya,
anyway, here is my links:

my github: https://github.com/SuperNReal
my social media: https://supernserver.ddns.net/socialAccounts

almost forgot!, to run my code you need at least python 3.10.6 and pygame 2.3.0,
see ya (✌ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞.
